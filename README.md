## 🎓 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Calculate CVSS Score

1. **Select Metrics**: Click buttons to choose values for all 8 base metrics
2. **Calculate**: Click "Calculate CVSS v3.1 Score" button
3. **View Results**: See score, severity, and vector string
4. **Copy or Screenshot**: Save your results

**Example Metrics:**
```
Attack Vector: Network (N)
Attack Complexity: Low (L)
Privileges Required: None (N)
User Interaction: None (N)
Scope: Unchanged (U)
Confidentiality: High (H)
Integrity: High (H)
Availability: High (H)
```

**Result:** Score: 9.8 - CRITICAL

## 🔧 Technical Details

### CVSS v3.1 Implementation

**Official Formula Used:**
```javascript
// Impact Sub Score (ISS)
ISS = 1 - ((1 - Confidentiality) × (1 - Integrity) × (1 - Availability))

// Impact
Impact (Unchanged Scope) = 6.42 × ISS
Impact (Changed Scope) = 7.52 × (ISS - 0.029) - 3.25 × (ISS - 0.02)^15

// Exploitability
Exploitability = 8.22 × AttackVector × AttackComplexity × PrivilegesRequired × UserInteraction

// Base Score
BaseScore (Unchanged) = min(Impact + Exploitability, 10)
BaseScore (Changed) = min(1.08 × (Impact + Exploitability), 10)

// Round up to 1 decimal place
FinalScore = ceil(BaseScore × 10) / 10
```

**Severity Ratings:**
| Score Range | Severity | Color |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| 0.0 | None | Blue |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | Low | Green |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium | Red |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | High | Orange |
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical | Dark Red |
